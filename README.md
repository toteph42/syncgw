**sync•gw** is the one and only fully portable server software available providing synchronization service between nearly any mobile device and your private server.

I could reach this outstanding flexibility by choosing PHP as the programming language. This programming language is available on all common web servers. As a result you don't need to worry about type of operating system your web synchronization server is running on or if **sync•gw** is compatible to your hardware.
 
Download and install our software and sync•gw is ready for use!

Our **sync•gw** server contains all protocol interfaces and libraries required for communication with devices.
How sync•gw improves productivity

Use **sync•gw** to backup your essential data - as soon as you've synchronized your client device, all data is 
saved - if you need to replace your cell-phone, simply synchronize with new device and you will immediately have access to all your data.
	
Using a local mail client like **Outlook** or **Thunderbird** or Personal Information Manager (PIM) on your 
laptop or desktop computer, use third party synchronization software plugins to synchronize with **sync•gw**
installation. Within minutes all of your contact data is available for synchronization with mobile devices.

Do you want to share your customer contacts or calendar data within your company? 

Feed data into **sync•gw** server and your employees can easily synchronize data on their hand held device from 
shared data store.

**[CalDav](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV), [CardDav](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV) protocol** 
**[MicroSoft Exchange ActiveSync (EAS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_ActiveSync)**. This extensive
